** Concepts and purpose

[[https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-55][ERC-55 mixed-case checksum address encoding]]

- ERC-55 address checksum :: The ERC-55 address checksum is a
  backward-compatible, mixed-case encoding of case-insensitive Ethereum
  addresses that incorporates a checksum into the now case-sensitive address by
  changing the capitalization of hex digit letters of the address. The address
  checksum conveys additional information without changing the semantic address
  value that is used to detect errors and protect against mistakes with the
  99.986% accuracy

** Design and implementation

- Address checksum :: The =address checksum= function
- Address verify :: The =address verify= function

** Testing and usage
